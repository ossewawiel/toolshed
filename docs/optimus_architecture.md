# Optimus Toolshed - Technology Architecture

## Technology Stack Overview

Optimus Toolshed is built on Kotlin Compose Multiplatform for Desktop, leveraging JetBrains' modern declarative UI framework to deliver a responsive and visually cohesive user experience. The Compose framework provides native desktop performance while enabling the implementation of Material Design principles through built-in components and theming capabilities. This technology choice supports the master/detail interface requirements through flexible layout composition and state management, allowing for dynamic content presentation based on user selections and system context.

The application architecture follows a plugin-based modular design where individual management tools are implemented as separate libraries with standardized integration APIs. Each plugin exposes its capabilities through a common interface that defines menu structure, detail panel content, and operational metadata, enabling the core application to dynamically discover and present available functionality. This approach ensures that new Optimus Server management capabilities can be integrated seamlessly without requiring modifications to the core application framework.

The plugin system operates through a well-defined contract that separates tool logic from presentation concerns, with each plugin responsible for providing its own Compose UI components while adhering to the application's design system guidelines. Runtime plugin discovery and loading mechanisms allow for flexible deployment scenarios where different installations can include only the tools relevant to their specific Optimus Server configuration, maintaining a lean footprint while preserving extensibility for complex enterprise environments.
